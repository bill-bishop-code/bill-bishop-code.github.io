_Devops is not a job title, it's a style of work_.

I highly recommend the book by Jeffery D. Smith _Operations Anti-Patterns, DevOps Solutions_.  I believe he has hit the nail on the head.  DevOps is about _softening_ the edges between traditional development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 

> "DevOps is about people first, then process, then tools"

Many organizations make the mistake of focusing on tools first to solve their operations issues.  Instead you need to achieve "buy-in" from the team.  Most problems are people problems (communication, knowledge, training, foresight, planning) and not technology (tools) problems.

### The CAMS Model

The CAMS Model is a set of values used by many successful DevOps focused organizations.  I won't go into detail since this has
been widely covered elsewhere, but improving on these 4 pillars is key!
